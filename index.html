    <h3>Uma...</h3>
    <h4>Developer and Lead Instructor</h4>
    <h3>About me</h3>
    <h5>I'm Uma, I'm a developer with a passion for teaching. I'm the lead instructor. 
         I've helped hundreds of thousands of students learn to code and change their lives by 
         becoming a developer.</h5>
    <h5>I spend most of my time researching how to make learning to code fun and make hard
         concepts easy to understand. I apply everything I discover into my bootcamp courses.
          In my courses, you'll find lots of geeky humour but also lots of explanations and animations 
          to make sure everything is easy to understand.</h5>
